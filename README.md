# Metapopulation-disease-modelling
Hi all! Here is some disease modelling work I did with the Wolfson Centre for Mathematical Biology at Oxford. 
I worked on metapopulation models and looked at the probability of a major outbreak given different index-case ages. 
I extended this work over two summers, incorporating factors like varying susceptibility and infectiousness.
